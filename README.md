# When-to-use-Python-vs-SQL-for-Delta-Live-Tables

Use SQL for:

Ingesting Data with Auto Loader: As seen in your code, cloud_files provides a simple, powerful way to set up incremental, schema-aware data ingestion directly in SQL.

sql
CREATE STREAMING LIVE TABLE churn_users_bronze ( ... )
COMMENT "raw user data ..."
AS SELECT * FROM cloud_files("${rawDataVolumeLoc}/users", "json", ...);
Standard Data Cleaning and Transformation: For common tasks like casting data types, renaming columns, and applying built-in SQL functions, the syntax is clean and universally understood. Your churn_users table is a great example of this.

sql
 Show full code block 
-- Cleaning and standardizing user data
AS SELECT
  id as user_id,
  sha1(email) as email, -- Anonymization
  to_timestamp(creation_date, "MM-dd-yyyy HH:mm:ss") as creation_date, -- Type casting
  initcap(firstname) as firstname, -- Simple string manipulation
  ...
from STREAM(live.churn_users_bronze)
Defining Data Quality Constraints: DLT's CONSTRAINT ... EXPECT syntax is a natural extension of SQL, making it easy to define and enforce data quality rules.

sql
CONSTRAINT user_valid_id EXPECT (user_id IS NOT NULL) ON VIOLATION DROP ROW
Aggregations and Joins: Standard SQL is the industry standard for performing aggregations (GROUP BY, count, sum) and joining datasets. Your churn_features table demonstrates this perfectly with its use of a Common Table Expression (CTE) to aggregate stats before joining them back to the user table.

Accessibility and Readability: A SQL DLT pipeline is easily understood by data analysts, data scientists, and data engineers, making collaboration and maintenance much simpler. The entire flow of data is clear from reading the queries.

When to Use Python in Delta Live Tables
You should switch to the Python API when your logic requires more than what standard SQL can provide. The Python API gives you the full programmatic power of PySpark and the entire Python ecosystem.

Use Python for:

Advanced Transformations & Complex Business Logic: If you need to apply a function to your data that doesn't exist in SQL (e.g., parsing a proprietary log format, complex string manipulation with advanced regex, custom financial calculations), you can define a Python function and apply it as a UDF.

Machine Learning Model Inference: This is a very common and powerful use case. You can load a pre-trained model (from MLflow, Hugging Face, etc.) and apply it to your streaming data to enrich it with predictions, such as a churn score. This is impossible in pure SQL.

Advanced Data Validation & Quality: While SQL constraints are great, Python allows for more complex rules. For example, you could validate a row by making an API call to an external system or by checking against a complex, pre-computed ruleset.

Reading from Custom Data Sources: If your data source isn't supported by Auto Loader (e.g., a proprietary binary format, a specific API endpoint), you can use Python to define a custom reader.

Dynamic Pipeline Generation: You can use Python's metaprogramming capabilities to generate your DLT pipeline dynamically based on a configuration file, which is impossible with static SQL definitions.

Python Code Example: Applying a Churn Model
Let's imagine you have a pre-trained churn prediction model in the MLflow Model Registry. Hereâ€™s how you would use the Python DLT API to apply it to the churn_features table. This is something you cannot do in SQL.

# The required imports that define the @dlt decorator
import dlt
from pyspark.sql import functions as F
import mlflow

# Assume the previous tables (users, orders, features) have been defined
# either in this Python script or in a separate SQL file.

# Load the registered ML model as a PySpark UDF
logged_model_uri = 'models:/churn_prediction_model/production'
predict_churn_udf = mlflow.pyfunc.spark_udf(spark, model_uri=logged_model_uri, result_type='double')

@dlt.table(
  comment="User features enriched with a real-time churn prediction score."
)
def churn_features_with_prediction():
  """
  Reads the combined user features and applies the ML model
  to generate a churn prediction score.
  """
  # Read the upstream features table as a streaming DataFrame
  features_df = dlt.read_stream("churn_features")

  # The model expects specific feature columns.
  # We select them and apply the model UDF to create a new 'prediction' column.
  prediction_df = features_df.withColumn(
    "churn_prediction_score",
    predict_churn_udf(
      F.struct(
        "order_count",
        "total_amount",
        "days_since_last_activity",
        "days_last_event"
        # ... and any other features the model was trained on
      )
    )
  )
  return prediction_df
